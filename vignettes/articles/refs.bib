  abstract = {Human activity and land management practices, in particular land use change, have resulted in the global loss of biodiversity. These types of disturbance affect the shape of macroecological patterns, and therefore analyzing these patterns can provide insights into how ecosystems are affected by land use change. We here use arthropod census data from 96 sites at Terceira Island in the Azores archipelago across four different land uses of increasing management intensity: native forest, exotic forest, semi-natural pasture and intensive pasture, to examine the effects of land use type on three macroecological patterns: the species abundance distribution, the metabolic rate distribution of individuals and the species--area relationship. The maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) has successfully predicted these patterns across habitats and taxa in undisturbed ecosystems, and thus provides a null expectation for their shapes. Across these patterns, we find that the forest habitats are the best fit by METE predictions, while the semi-natural pasture is consistently the worst fit, and the intensive pasture is intermediately well fit. We show that the direction of failure of the METE predictions at the pasture sites is likely due to the hyper-dominance of introduced spider species present there. We hypothesize that the particularly poor fit for the semi-natural pasture is due to the mix of arthropod communities out of equilibrium, leading to greater heterogeneity in composition and complex dynamics that violate METE's assumption of static state variables. The comparative better fit for the intensive pasture plausibly results from more homogeneous arthropod communities that are well adapted to intensive management, and thus whose state variables are less in flux. Analyzing deviations from theoretical predictions across land use type provides useful information about how land use and disturbance affect ecosystems, and such comparisons could be useful across other habitats and taxa.},

  abstract = {A goal of every science is comprehensive theory that is predictive, realistic, and parsimonious. Is such theory possible in ecology? The sheer complexity, historical contingency, and scale-dependence of organisms and their interactions with their surroundings suggest to many a negative answer. This book answers yes. Rather than building and combining mechanistic models of ecosystems, the approach here is grounded in information theory and the logic of inference. Paralleling the derivation of thermodynamics from the maximum entropy principle, the state variable theory of ecology developed in the book predicts realistic forms for all metrics of ecology that describe patterns in the distribution, abundance, and energetics of species across multiple spatial scales. Part I is foundational, discussing the nature of theory, the relationship of ecology to other sciences, and the concept of the logic of inference. Parts II and III, respectively, present the fundamentals of macroecology and of maximum information entropy from the ground up. Part IV integrates the fundamentals, leading to the derivation and testing of the predictions of the maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE). Part V widens the perspective by showing how METE can help clarify several major issues in conservation biology, placing METE in context with other theories, and pointing readers along avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Many fundamental properties of ecological systems and interactions are tied to body size and a related metric, the metabolic rate distribution, both within and across species. A previously proposed maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) predicts numerous interrelated macroecological patterns, including spatial distributions of individuals within species, abundance distributions across species, species area relationships, and distributions of metabolic rates of all individuals within a community. Extensive tests of METE's macroecological predictions generally support the theory, but two related predictions have not been evaluated against full community census data: the distribution of metabolic rates of individuals within species as a function of the abundance of the species and the distribution of average individual metabolic rates across species. We test the metabolic predictions of METE for herbaceous plants in a subalpine meadow and show that while this theory realistically predicts the distribution of individual metabolic rates across the entire community, the within- and across-species predictions generally fail. We also test the energy-equivalence type prediction that arises as a consequence of the prediction for the distribution of average individual metabolic rates across species. We suggest several possible explanations for the empirical deviations from theory, and distinguish between the expected deviations caused by ecological disturbance and those deviations that might be corrected within the theory.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that frequency distributions of individual tree masses in natural stands are characterized by power-law distributions with exponents near -3/4, and that therefore tree communities exhibit energetic equivalence among size classes. Because the mass of trees is not measured directly, but estimated from diameter, this supposition is based on the fact that the observed distribution of tree diameters is approximately characterized by a power-law with an exponent {$\approx$} -2. Here we show that diameter distributions of this form are not equivalent to mass distributions with exponents of -3/4, but actually to mass distributions with exponents of -11/8. We discuss the implications of this result for the metabolic theory of ecology and for understanding energetic equivalence and the processes structuring tree communities.},

We evaluated four major predictions of METE simultaneously at an unprecedented scale using data from 60 globally distributed forest communities including more than 300,000 individuals and nearly 2,000 species. METE successfully captured 96\% and 89\% of the variation in the rank distribution of species abundance and individual size but performed poorly when characterizing the size-density relationship and intraspecific distribution of individual size. Specifically, METE predicted a negative correlation between size and species abundance, which is weak in natural communities. By evaluating multiple predictions with large quantities of data, our study not only identifies a mismatch between abundance and body size in METE but also demonstrates the importance of conducting strong tests of ecological theories.},

  abstract = {The maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) applies the concept of "entropy" from information theory to predict macroecological patterns. The energetic predictions of the METE rely on predetermined metabolic scaling from external theories, and this reliance diminishes the testability of the theory. In this work, I build parameterized METE models by treating the metabolic scaling exponent as a free parameter, and I use the maximum-likelihood method to obtain empirically plausible estimates of the exponent. I test the models using the individual tree data from an oak-dominated deciduous forest in the northeastern United States and from a tropical forest in central Panama. My analysis shows that the metabolic scaling exponents predicted from the parameterized METE models deviate from that of the metabolic theory of ecology and exhibit large variation, at both community and population levels. Assemblage and population abundance may act as ecological constraints that regulate the individual-level metabolic scaling behavior. This study provides a novel example of the use of the parameterized METE models to reveal the biological processes of individual organisms. The implication and possible extensions of the parameterized METE models are discussed.},

  abstract = {Metabolic scaling provides valuable information about the physiological and ecological functions of organisms, although few studies have quantified the metabolic scaling exponent (b) of communities under natural conditions. Maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) is a constraint-based unified theory with the potential to empirically assess the spatial variation of the metabolic scaling. Our main goal is to develop a novel method of estimating b within a community by integrating metabolic scaling and METE. We also aim to study the relationships between the estimated b and environmental variables across communities. We developed a new METE framework to estimate b in 118 stream fish communities in the north-eastern Iberian Peninsula. We first extended the original maximum entropy model by parameterizing b in the model prediction of the community-level individual size distributions and compared our results with empirical and theoretical predictions. We then tested the effects of abiotic conditions, species composition and human disturbance on the spatial variation of community-level b. We found that community-level b of the best maximum entropy models showed great spatial variability, ranging from 0.25 to 2.38. The mean exponent (b = 0.93) resembled the community-aggregated mean values from three previous metabolic scaling meta-analyses, all of which were greater than the theoretical predictions of 0.67 and 0.75. Furthermore, the generalized additive model showed that b reached maximum at the intermediate mean annual precipitation level and declined significantly as human disturbance intensified. The parameterized METE is proposed here as a novel framework for estimating the metabolic pace of life of stream fish communities. The large spatial variation of b may reflect the combined effects of environmental constraints and species interactions, which likely have important feedback on the structure and function of natural communities. Our newly developed framework can also be applied to study the impact of global environmental pressures on metabolic scaling and energy use in other ecosystems.},
